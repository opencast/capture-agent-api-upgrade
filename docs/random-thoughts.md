Some Random Thoughts
--------------------
*Just noted here so they will not get lost*

By defining a base API and extensions, CA vendors can provide a matrix as an
easy to grasp way for users to see what the device is capable of. Example:

    Base API                     ✓
    Live status                  ✓
    Preview image                ✕
    Recording buffer             ✓
    Live streaming               ✕
    Input selection              ✓
    Environment selection        ✕



- We need a compatible way for vendors to indicate that they support capture duration extension
