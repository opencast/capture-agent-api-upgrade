Requirements/Wishes Extracted From Talk With Vendors and Users
--------------------------------------------------------------
*Notes from Lars based on CA-API Sessions @Mancheser-Conference & Extron Meeting*

 - Do not break the old API
    - Point made by several vendors
    - Old devices that are out there right now should still work
    - We need versioning
 - Make the API modular
    - Not all CAs need to provide everything
    - Create a small, easy to implement base API
    - Create extensions
    - Base API could be current mandatory API part:
       - send status
       - get schedule
       - ingest
    - Extensions could be things like
       - Provides live status information
		    - Preview images
			 - Preview stream
       - Selection of inputs
       - Selection of environments
 - Clearly define how metadata should be handled
    - What should a CA do with passed metadata
    - Is a CA allowed to modify or add metadata
    - How should metadata be added
 - Capture device API
    - Define common places to get status information from a capture agent
    - Define information a capture agent should provide
    - Examples
       - JSON with status information
       - preview image
    - For tools like CA dashboard
 - WebSocket Communication for Server to CA Communication
    - Idea from vendors
    - Makes it possible to get through firewall
    - No real example for what this would be used
 - Normalization of Input Names
	 - If a screen recording is selected it should be possible to swap the CA
		and it should not break because it does not know the term
    - If terms are not knows CA should fall back to default inputs
    - We should define a set of recommended terms to use
    - CA vendors should still be able to extend this set of terms
 - Switch to common format for input specification
    - Most things can be defined using JSON
    - Not using JSON at the moment:
       - iCal for schedule
       - XML for inputs
 - Let CA specify environments
    - Additional settings for ca to set
	 - Example: A CA may specify that it supports an environment “Blackboard”
		which, attached to a scheduled recording definition will make the CA send
		some commands to a PTZ camera, …
    - Combine this with input specification? *(-lars)*
    - Things that may be done based on an environment:
       - Send HTTP requests
       - Send RS232 commands
       - Control Visca PTZ camera
 - Provide a CA test case
    - Script to run against a CA, ensuring basic functionality
 - How to handle live streaming events
    - Start separate discussion on list
    - Harvard DCE has something
    - NCast has something
 - Add support for a CA description *(MH-8963)*
